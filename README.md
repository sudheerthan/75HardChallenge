## The 8 Daily Tasks

## How It Works

### Day Progression System
- Start on Day 1 when you first open the app
- Complete all 8 tasks throughout your day
- When all tasks are checked off, you can complete the day
- Upon day completion, you automatically advance to the next day
- Days cannot be reset once completed (maintains challenge integrity)

### Data Persistence
- All progress is saved locally using SharedPreferences
- Your current day, task completions, and statistics persist between app sessions
- Each completed day is permanently recorded for statistics
